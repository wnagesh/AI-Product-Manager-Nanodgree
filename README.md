# AI-Product-Manager-Nanodgree

The repo involves the project work I complited in the AI Product Manager Nanodegree. 

Where I learned to evaluate the business value of an AI product. 

scoping and building a data set, train a model, and evaluate its business impact.

and to ensure a product is successful by focusing on scalability, potential biases, and compliance.

along with reviewing case studies and examples to focus on how to define metrics to measure the business value for a proposed product.


## Following are the projects implemented in the programme 

### 1. Medical Image Annotation Data Set with Figure Eight

### 2. Build a Model with Google AutoML to classify images as having pneumonia symptoms or healthy.

### 3.Developed a business proposal for an AI product called "Automatic License Plate Recognition".
